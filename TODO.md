help me apply these feedback notes into @attempt1TextOnly.py 

Ill add it, you just guide where and what you’re one inch from a MOMDP, but you haven’t drawn the line between what’s seen and what’s hidden, and you haven’t written the three boring functions every grown-up planner needs: T, O, R. Do that, and you’re in.

Here’s the exact patch list.

1) Split the state: observed vs hidden

Write this as a single, explicit line in your notebook. No vibes.

Observed (x): checklist, step, any filled slots this session, and any facts you just retrieved with high provenance.

Hidden (y): unfilled slot values, subgraph_id (top-M), novelty/ood, maybe provenance quality.

MOMDP means you keep a belief only over y, conditioned on the known x.

2) Transitions T(s'|s,a) with the MOMDP factorization

Stop hand-waving “carryover.” Specify:

𝑇
𝑥
(
𝑥
′
∣
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑎
)
T
x
	​

(x
′
∣x,y,a):

Steps advance deterministically when preconditions met; otherwise stay.

Filled slots in x stay filled.

𝑇
𝑦
(
𝑦
′
∣
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑎
)
T
y
	​

(y
′
∣x,y,a):

Unfilled slots persist; some get filled after ASK/SEARCH.

subgraph_id mostly sticks (say 0.95), can switch a bit if novelty is high.

Novelty decays.

You can keep it all as tiny tables and if-statements. No one is grading elegance.

3) Action-conditioned observation model O(o|x',y',a)

Your draft has likelihoods, but not per action. You need:

ASK(slot r): categorical with a confusion rate 
𝜖
𝑟
ϵ
r
	​

. Define outcomes like {value candidates, UNKNOWN}.

𝑃
(
𝑜
=
𝑣
∣
𝑥
′
,
𝑦
′
,
𝑎
=
ASK
(
𝑟
)
)
=
{
1
−
𝜖
𝑟
	
if true value is 
𝑣


𝜖
𝑟
/
(
𝐾
−
1
)
	
otherwise
P(o=v∣x
′
,y
′
,a=ASK(r))={
1−ϵ
r
	​

ϵ
r
	​

/(K−1)
	​

if true value is v
otherwise
	​


SEARCH(local/web): outcomes {success, fail}. On success, you observe one or more slot values or prune subgraphs.

ANSWER: optional terminal correctness signal if you get feedback; else no observation, just end.

This makes your EIG more than a guess.

4) Belief update over the hidden part only

Write the actual update you’ll run:

𝑏
𝑡
+
1
(
𝑦
′
)
∝
𝑂
(
𝑜
𝑡
+
1
∣
𝑥
′
,
𝑦
′
,
𝑎
𝑡
)
  
∑
𝑦
𝑇
𝑦
(
𝑦
′
∣
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑎
𝑡
)
 
𝑏
𝑡
(
𝑦
)
b
t+1
	​

(y
′
)∝O(o
t+1
	​

∣x
′
,y
′
,a
t
	​

)
y
∑
	​

T
y
	​

(y
′
∣x,y,a
t
	​

)b
t
	​

(y)

x is observed, so no belief over it. Yes, this is the spine.

5) Reward model R(x,y,a) and terminal condition

You listed costs in prose. Commit numbers.

R_correct for a correct ANSWER, C_wrong for a wrong one.

C_ask, C_search, plus a tiny per-turn time tax.

Terminal: when ANSWER fires, episode ends. Log the outcome.

Without R, planning is cosplay.

6) Initial belief and carryover

Define 
𝑏
0
(
𝑦
∣
𝑥
0
)
b
0
	​

(y∣x
0
	​

): uniform over subgraph_id and slot values, with type constraints.
Carry to next turn with your “inertia” ρ, but through 
𝑇
𝑦
T
y
	​

, not a temperature softmax.

7) Decision rule that actually uses O and T

Keep it myopic if you want sanity:

𝑉

𝑝

(
𝑏
)
 
𝑅

(

Pick argmax. Add a small unlock bonus if an outcome satisfies next-step preconditions.

8) Independence assumptions, written down

You’re already factorizing. Make it official:

𝑏
(
𝑦
)
=
𝑏
(
subgraph
)
∏
𝑟
𝑏
(
slot
𝑟
)
b(y)=b(subgraph)∏
r
	​

b(slot
r
	​

)

Only let ASK/SEARCH touch the relevant factors. No silent cross-talk.

9) Map your existing machinery into MOMDP boxes

Your δ_sem/δ_struct/δ_terms likelihoods become pieces of 
𝑂
(
𝑜
∣
𝑥
′
,
𝑦
′
,
𝑎
)
O(o∣x
′
,y
′
,a) when the action is “observe passive text” or “SEARCH success.”

Your selective activation and priors become 
𝑏
0
b
0
	​

 and parts of 
𝑇
𝑦
T
y
	​

 stickiness.

Your “posterior softmax temperature” is now just a shortcut for belief update when you don’t have clean O. Use it carefully.

Tiny to-do list you can actually implement today

Keep it to one page. You’re allergic to bloat; so am I.

Add a code cell: state = {'x': {...}, 'b_y': {'subgraph': cat, 'slots': {r: cat}}}

Write transition_x(x,y,a) and transition_y(y,x,a) as small functions.

Write observe_prob(o,x_prime,y_prime,a) with ε for ASK and p_success for SEARCH.

Implement belief_update(b_y, x, a, o) with the MOMDP formula above.

Pin numbers: R_correct, C_wrong, C_ask, C_search, lambda_eig, epsilon_r, p_success.

Replace your EIG proxy with the real expected entropy drop using observe_prob and belief_update.

Add done = (a=='ANSWER') and compute reward. Log everything.

Do those seven and congratulations: it’s a MOMDP
