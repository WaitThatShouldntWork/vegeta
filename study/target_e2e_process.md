# Brain to Machine Learning: Neural Information Processing

This document explores the conversation about how the human brain translates information from memory into semantic output, and how this relates to building machine learning systems that mimic these processes.

## How the Human Brain Translates Memory to Semantic Output

### The Core Question
How does the human brain translate information stored in memory (represented in latent space) into semantic space (writing onto paper)?

### The Neural Pipeline

Your brain isn't exactly running a tidy "latent space → semantic space" export function like a well-behaved machine learning model, but the comparison isn't totally wrong.

#### Step 1: Retrieval and Reconstruction
Information in memory isn't stored as clean sentences or diagrams. It's distributed across neural networks—more like patterns of activation than neatly labeled files. When you "remember," you're reconstructing that pattern from cues (a prompt, an intention, a smell of coffee that drags up last week's meeting). That's your "latent" representation: it's compressed, context-dependent, and fuzzy.

#### Step 2: Conceptual Mapping
The brain's semantic system—frontotemporal regions especially—takes that fuzzy pattern and maps it onto structured concepts. This is where you pull up words, categories, and meaning. If you're about to write "dog," you're not recalling an English dictionary entry but activating networks that encode "four-legged thing, pet, tail-wags, barks," and then language areas (Broca's, Wernicke's, etc.) translate that into linguistic form.

#### Step 3: Motor Planning
Once the semantic idea is "dog," another pipeline kicks in: the prefrontal cortex sequences the motor plan, the premotor and motor cortex orchestrate your hand movements, and the cerebellum smooths it out so the result doesn't look like a toddler's scrawl.

#### The Messy Reality
It's not a one-way street. Writing feeds back into memory, memory gets reshaped by writing, and the words you choose constrain what you "remember." Unlike a neural net, the brain doesn't have a clean separation between "latent vector" and "semantic layer." It's all just messy, recursive firing across distributed networks.

**Summary:** The brain does a lossy reconstruction of stored patterns, translates them into linguistic form through semantic and language networks, then runs it through motor circuits so your hand can scribble something legible. Every step introduces distortion—your memories aren't pristine, and your words never quite match the thought.

## Detailed Translation Process

### 1. Encodings in Memory

**Distributed representations:** Memories aren't stored as discrete files. They're encoded as patterns of activation across populations of neurons in the hippocampus and neocortex.

**Latent-ish quality:** This looks a lot like a high-dimensional embedding. The "dog you saw yesterday" lives as a vector of associations—shape, smell, emotions—scattered across sensory and associative cortices.

**Reconstruction, not retrieval:** Remembering is probabilistic pattern completion. The hippocampus cues cortical ensembles to re-fire in the approximate shape of the past experience.

### 2. From Encoded Pattern → Semantic Framework

**Concept binding:** Association cortices (temporal and parietal lobes) pull together multimodal features into a concept. This is your "semantic space." Instead of that dog yesterday, you stabilize on the abstract category DOG.

**Abstraction step:** The prefrontal cortex suppresses irrelevant detail ("it was raining," "I was holding coffee") so you can translate the memory into communicable semantic units.

### 3. Semantic → Linguistic Representation

**Lexical access:** Left middle temporal gyrus and angular gyrus retrieve word candidates that match the concept. DOG → {"dog," "puppy," "hound"…}.

**Syntactic scaffolding:** Broca's area (left inferior frontal gyrus) figures out how the word fits into a sentence structure. If you're writing "The dog barked", it builds the subject-verb-object plan.

**Phonological encoding:** Even for writing, your brain often runs words through phonological form (inner speech) before converting them to orthography. That's why you "hear" the sentence in your head before the pen moves.

### 4. Linguistic Plan → Motor Output

**Graphemic buffer:** Short-term storage of the exact letter sequence. Think of it as the working memory slot that holds D-O-G until your hand executes it.

**Motor planning:** Premotor cortex and supplementary motor areas script the stroke sequence.

**Execution & correction:** Motor cortex fires the hand/arm muscles; cerebellum corrects the sloppy real-world execution. Visual feedback keeps you from writing hieroglyphics by accident.

### The Translation "Glue"

The trickiest part is how the fuzzy latent patterns (Step 1) become semantic categories (Step 2). That involves:

- **Hebbian association** (neurons that fire together wire together), so your brain has learned which ensembles mean "dog."
- **Cortico-hippocampal dialogue**, replaying compressed traces into cortical schemas.
- **Predictive coding:** your prefrontal cortex guesses what you meant and constrains the search space, so you don't spend five minutes fishing for the word "dog."

**Pipeline summary:**
```
latent encodings (distributed cortical traces) 
→ semantic category assemblies 
→ lexical & syntactic representations 
→ graphemic/motor plans 
→ squiggles on paper
```

Each step is noisy, lossy, and subject to interference. Which is why people forget names, invent details, or accidentally write "God" instead of "dog."

## Machine Learning Analogies

### Has ML tried to copy this?

Yes, but it's exactly as messy as you'd expect when humans try to build silicon parodies of their own biology.

#### 1. LLM Decoder ≈ Semantic Translation
- Transformers map an embedding (latent space) into structured sequences. That's basically what your brain does: distributed memory → ordered language.
- Attention in the decoder is a cheap imitation of how cortical networks "focus" on relevant associations when producing a sentence.
- **But:** LLMs don't reconstruct episodic memories. They don't retrieve and compress; they just predict the next symbol given the latent.

#### 2. Explicit Memory Models
- **Neural Turing Machines / Differentiable Neural Computers** (DeepMind, mid-2010s): tried to mimic hippocampus-style memory storage and recall. They built external "memory slots" you could read/write like a computer, inspired by episodic retrieval.
- **Memory-augmented transformers** (e.g. RAG, RETRO, GraphRAG): same principle. They fetch patterns from long-term storage and insert them back into the decoder stream, mimicking hippocampal–cortical replay.

#### 3. Semantic Bottlenecks
Some researchers build models where the latent gets mapped into a semantic code layer (structured concepts, not raw embeddings) before decoding. This is like forcing the network to represent "DOG" as a discrete node before writing sentences.

#### 4. Cognitive Architectures
**ACT-R, Soar, SPAUN:** decades-old attempts to simulate cognition end-to-end, with modules for memory, language, motor planning. SPAUN even controlled a robot arm to write numbers after "thinking" about them. 

#### 5. Brain-inspired Decoding
Recent work in brain-to-text translation (e.g., UCSF, Stanford 2023) uses transformers to decode neural recordings from speech or motor cortex into written sentences. That's basically stealing the brain's latent → semantic → graphemic pipeline wholesale.

**The fact that transformers are the winning architecture here is telling: our cortex may not literally be a transformer, but the analogy isn't crazy.**

So yes: the decoder of an LLM is a distant cousin of what your brain's language network does. But unlike you, the model doesn't hallucinate because it had a bad night's sleep—it hallucinates because the math says the probability distribution doesn't care if it's lying.

## Building a Crude Imitation Design

### The Challenge
I want to store "memories", facts and slots in a knowledge graph, and embed that graph (by which means, vector embedding, pagerank/Castro). I can use that latent space to do free energy calculations. Where I'm stuck is: say I do a similar predictive coding and sub graph retrieval, how I would point that fuzzy cluster back to the part of the graph.

### The Solution: Two-way Bridge Between Fuzzy and Crisp

You need a two-way bridge between your fuzzy latent soup and crisp graph objects. That means:
1. Encode graph things into vectors
2. Retrieve candidate anchors from that space
3. Expand into candidate subgraphs inside Neo4j
4. Score them with a predictive-coding style objective so you can point back to exact nodes/edges

### Graph Shape Worth Using

Use typed nodes and edges. Keep it boring and explicit.

```cypher
(:Entity {type, names[], text, embedding[]})
(:Fact {value, confidence, time, embedding[]})
(:Slot {schema, role, constraints, embedding[]})
(:Schema {name, slots[], embedding[]}) for your "frames"
```

Relations: 
- `(:Entity)-[:HAS_FACT]->(:Fact)`
- `(:Entity)-[:PLAYS {role}]->(:Slot)`
- `(:Slot)-[:PART_OF]->(:Schema)`

### Making the Latent Space Point Back

#### Per-node/edge embeddings
- Text fields → sentence/embedding model per label type (entities, facts, slots). Store as `embedding[]`.
- Relation-aware embeddings → use GDS: fastRP, node2vec, or graphSAGE with relation-type features. Concatenate: `[text_emb | structural_emb]`.
- Optional: a small hyperbolic (Poincaré) embedding for hierarchies and taxonomies.

#### Subgraph "sketch" embeddings
For each node, precompute a neighborhood signature (k-hop bag of edge types + node labels, hashed). WL-style features are fine. Pool into a fixed vector.

#### Indexes
```cypher
CREATE VECTOR INDEX idx_ent_emb IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (n:Entity) ON (n.embedding)
OPTIONS {indexConfig: { 
  'vector.dimensions': 768, 
  'vector.similarity_function': 'cosine'
}};
```

### Runtime Pipeline (Predictive-Coding Flavored)

#### Step A: Anchor retrieval (latent → candidate nodes)
- kNN over `idx_*` to get top-k anchors A = {a_i} with scores s_i = cos(e_q, e_{a_i}).
- Turn this into a soft pointer distribution: `p(a_i | q) = softmax(s_i / τ)`

#### Step B: Graph expansion (anchors → candidate subgraphs)
**PPR expansion:** Personalized PageRank seeded by A (use weights p(a_i|q) as seeds).

**Typed BFS with budget:** Expand r hops along allowed relations, keep top nodes.

**Schema-guided expansion:** If a :Schema is predicted from q, expand to slots required by that schema.

#### Step C: Candidate subgraph readout
```
readout(S_j) = pool( {w_k * e_node_k} ∪ {u_m * e_edge_m} ∪ {neighborhood_sketch} )
```

#### Step D: Predictive-coding style scoring
```
F(S_j | q) = 
  - α * cos(e_q, readout(S_j))           // semantic fit
  + β * structure_penalty(S_j)           // missing slots, cycles
  + γ * KL(p_prior || p_post_j)          // divergence from prior
  + δ * surprise(S_j | expectations)     // slot-level prediction error
```

#### Step E: Hard pointer back to graph
Take the best S*. The "fuzzy cluster" becomes:
- A crisp set of node ids and relationship ids.
- A provenance: anchors A, expansion method, parameters, and F terms.

## Key Concepts Explained

### WL-style Features
**WL** stands for Weisfeiler–Lehman, a graph isomorphism test. It's a way to describe a node by looking at its neighbors, then neighbors-of-neighbors, etc., and hashing that info into a signature.

Example: "This node is connected to two 'Person' nodes and one 'Company' node, and those in turn connect to X, Y, Z." That description becomes a feature vector you can compare with others.

### Hyperbolic (Poincaré) Embedding
- Normal embeddings are Euclidean: they live in flat space (like plotting dots on paper).
- Hyperbolic embeddings live in curved space (a Poincaré ball).
- **Why bother?** Because hyperbolic space is good at representing hierarchies.
- Example: an "animal → mammal → dog" tree. In Euclidean space, you'd waste tons of dimensions. In hyperbolic space, the geometry naturally handles branching trees compactly.

### Polysemy Issue
**Polysemy** = "one word, many meanings."
- Example: "Bank" = place with money, or side of a river.
- If your graph has a node `:Entity {name:"Bank"}` and you only store one embedding, it has to be both finance and rivers at once.
- **Fixes:** either split them into separate nodes (Bank[finance], Bank[river]) or store multiple embeddings/senses per node.

## Selective Activation Process

### Initial Subgraph Anchor Candidates
1. Embed the user utterance → q_text (e.g., 768-dim using nomic-text-embed via ollama).
2. k-NN **against text_emb** to get initial recall scores s_text. [index: idx_text, metric: cosine]
3. For reranking, k-NN **against graph_emb** to get s_graph. [index: idx_graph, metric: cosine]
4. Normalize scores (z-score or min-max per list), then combine:
   ```
   s_combined = w1 * s_text + w2 * s_graph  [start w1=0.7, w2=0.3]
   ```
5. Rank by s_combined and take top-K anchor nodes. [K ≈ 10]

### Neighborhood Signature (for subgraph vectors)
For each anchor, summarize its local structure so we can compare subgraphs:
- Collect k-hop neighborhood (e.g., k=1..2).
- Count node labels and edge types (a "bag of types").
- Optionally hash/encode counts into a fixed vector using WL-style features.
- **Fuse vectors by concatenation:**
  ```
  vec_subgraph = [pooled_node_emb || structure_vector]
  ```
  (Only average if both vectors are in the same space/scale, which they usually aren't.)

### Expand into Neighborhoods
For each anchor, induce a small candidate subgraph:
- **Method A:** fixed-radius expansion (e.g., 2 hops, typed edge filter).
- **Method B:** personalized PageRank seeded by anchors (budgeted top-N nodes).
- **Add variance:** different anchors, radii, or seed mixes to avoid clones.

### Score Candidate Subgraphs
For each candidate subgraph S:
- **Semantic fit:** cosine(q_text, vec_subgraph) [vec_subgraph = concat(node pool ⊕ structure sketch)]
- **Structure fit:** does S match expected schema/slots? [missing_required_slots → penalty]
- **Weirdness penalty:** downweight hubs/noisy detours. [cap hub degree; community consistency]

Final score:
```
score(S) = α * semantic_fit
          - β * schema_missing_penalty
          - γ * hubiness_penalty  [start α=1.0, β=0.5, γ=0.2]
```

### Select the Best Candidate
- Keep top-M by score(S) (e.g., M=10) and optionally rerank with a small cross-encoder on a textified summary.
- Return the winning subgraph's concrete IDs: node_ids + rel_ids. [this collapses the fuzzy cluster back to crisp graph data]

### Keep a Retrieval Log (Provenance)
Persist:
- query embedding/version, anchor IDs + scores, expansion params,
- candidate subgraph IDs + scores/penalties,
- final selection (node_ids, rel_ids), timestamp.

This makes the process reproducible and debuggable.

## Vector Fusion Strategies

### String vs Node Embeddings

**String embedding (text → vector):**
- Use when your node has descriptive text (names, labels, descriptions, docs)
- Great for matching user queries written in natural language
- Example: node `(:Product {name:"Mortgage Loan", desc:"fixed interest, 25 years"})`

**Node embedding (node2vec, GraphSAGE, FastRP, etc.):**
- Use when you want the vector to capture graph structure (who connects to who, what types of relationships)
- Great for similarity like "these two customers behave the same in the graph even if their names differ"

**Best practice:** Combine them.
- Concatenate or average `[text_emb | graph_emb]`
- That way you get both semantic content and structural context.

### Concat vs Average

**Concatenate [vec_nodes || vec_structure]:**
- Your node vector and structure vector are different beasts (they are).
- You want to keep both signals without smearing them together.
- You can handle a bigger vector in your index.
- Result: safer, more expressive. **Default choice.**

**Average (w1·vec_nodes + w2·vec_structure) / (w1+w2):**
- Both vectors already live in the same space and are similarly scaled.
- You're chasing a tiny memory/latency win and don't want to grow dimensions.
- Result: simpler, but risky if spaces differ.

### Practical Recipe
1. Always L2-normalize each component first.
2. If concatenating, optionally scale: `[α·vec_nodes || β·vec_structure]` with α=1, β≈0.5 to stop structure from dominating.
3. After fusion, L2-normalize again before cosine.

## Bayesian Active Inference Framework

### Theory Foundation: Bayesian Brain Model
The Bayesian brain maintains beliefs about hidden causes v of sensory data u. It generates predictions u' from beliefs via generative model p(u|v), compares to actual sensations, and updates beliefs to reduce prediction error.

**Key insight:** Exact Bayesian inference p(v|u) is intractable, so we use approximate posterior q_φ(v) and minimize variational free energy:

```
F(φ) = KL[q_φ(v) || p(v)] - E_q[log p(u|v)]
```

This balances complexity (stay close to prior) vs accuracy (explain data).

### Latent State Variables

The simplified, factorized belief state:

```
q(v) = q(z_checklist)
       · q(z_goal | z_checklist, history)
       · q(z_subgraph | z_checklist, anchors)
       · ∏_r q(z_slot_r | z_subgraph, z_checklist)
       · q(z_novelty | anchors, distances)
```

**Terminology clarification:** 
- **z_*** = the hidden states (unknown reality this turn)
- **p(·)** = starting belief (prior, before you look)
- **q(·)** = updated belief (posterior, after you look)

### Checklists vs Goals

**Checklist (z_checklist):** "which playbook makes sense here?"
- Examples: LoanApplication vs MovieQuery vs EligibilityCheck vs None
- Built from: frequency in logs, recent convo summary, tiny user-profile nudge, and ALWAYS a "None" option

**Goal (z_goal):** "what is the user probably trying to DO right now?"
- Examples: identify a film, get a recommendation, verify a fact, play 20Q, ask the agent to act
- Built from: lightweight intent classifier over the last 1–3 turns + checklist↔goal compatibility table

### Priors in Plain Language

#### Prior over Checklist p(z_checklist)
What we believe before looking at this exact utterance:
- **Frequency:** which checklists are common in our logs
- **Recency/context:** things discussed in the last few turns get a boost (with time decay)
- **User profile:** tiny nudge if we know the user's domain
- **Null option:** always keep "none-of-the-above" nonzero to avoid forcing a bad fit

#### Prior over Goal p(z_goal | history)
What the user is probably trying to do:
- **Intent classifier** on the last 1–3 turns gives logits → convert to probabilities
- **Compatibility:** some checklists pair better with some goals (a small lookup table)

#### Prior over Subgraph p(z_subgraph | anchors)
Which candidate chunk of the graph should win before detailed scoring:
- **Retrieval softmax:** normalize your combined anchor/candidate scores (temperature τ)
- **Simplicity:** smaller subgraphs get a gentle boost (don't over-explain)
- **Provenance:** edges/facts with better sources raise the prior
- **Recency:** nodes touched recently get a tiny bump

#### Slot Priors p(z_slot_r)
For each REQUIRED blank field in the chosen checklist, start with a reasonable initial guess distribution over possible fillers:
- **Uniform** if you truly know nothing
- **Popularity** in the candidate neighborhood (common fillers get more prior mass)
- **Type constraints:** IMPOSSIBLE types get probability = 0 from the start

#### Novelty/OOD Prior p(z_novelty)
"Does this look outside our comfort zone?"
- **Low max similarity** to all anchors (text doesn't match anything)
- **High distance** from known clusters (e.g., Mahalanobis/z-score in embedding space)
- **Poor checklist likelihood** (utterance doesn't fit any checklist language)

### Active Inference Process

#### After we get q(v): the Active Inference Loop

We have an updated belief q(v). If it's confident, we answer. If it's uncertain or noisy, we choose an action that is expected to reduce uncertainty the most (for the least pain).

#### Quick Uncertainty Readout
- **Global uncertainty:** entropy H[q(z_checklist)], H[q(z_subgraph)] and margin (top1 - top2)
- **Slot uncertainty:** entropy per required slot H_r over {fillers + "unknown"}
- **Novelty/OOD:** max cosine to anchors, distance to known clusters
- **Noise estimate:** likelihood variance σ² and posterior temperature τ

#### Actions We Can Take
- **ANSWER:** commit now. Fast, but risk of being wrong.
- **ASK:** one targeted question to the user (fills the most uncertain/high-impact slot).
- **SEARCH:** fetch external evidence (web/KB) to confirm or disconfirm top candidates.

#### Expected Information Gain (EIG)
```
EIG(action) ≈ how much we expect our uncertainty to drop after we take that action
EIG = H[current] - E_{outcome}[ H[posterior after outcome] ]
```

- **For ASK(slot r):** simulate a few likely user answers, update beliefs hypothetically, measure the average entropy drop.
- **For SEARCH:** simulate outcomes (confirm, disconfirm, find new candidate), use historical calibration.
- **For ANSWER:** EIG ≈ 0. It doesn't reduce uncertainty; it just ends the turn.

#### Utility = Gain - Cost - Risk
```
Utility(action) = EIG(action) - Cost(action) - Risk(action)
```
- **Cost(ASK):** user friction + extra turns
- **Cost(SEARCH):** latency, API $, distraction risk
- **Risk(ANSWER):** expected error cost = (1 - q_top1_conf) * error_penalty

### Decision Policy

#### High-level Rules
1. If `q(top1) ≥ θ_conf` and `H[q(v)] ≤ θ_entropy` and required slots filled: → **ANSWER**
2. Else compute `EIG_ASK` for top k slots by entropy H_r, normalized by question cost
3. Compute `EIG_SEARCH` for a targeted retrieval if candidates disagree structurally
4. Pick action with highest Utility; break ties by lowest latency

#### Detecting Known vs Unknown Unknowns

**Known unknown (good news, just ask):**
- Posterior focused on one checklist/subgraph but one or two slots have high entropy
- Action: ASK for the highest EIG slot. The question is surgical.

**Unknown unknown (probably search):**
- Posterior spread across unrelated checklists, or OOD signals are high
- Action: SEARCH with a broadening query, or restate that scope may be outside knowledge

### Implementation Pipeline Summary

#### Stage A — Build Hypotheses + Co-priors
1. **Co-priors in parallel:** p0(z_checklist) and p0(z_goal) from history/keywords/frequency
2. **Selective activation:** Embed utterance → kNN → anchors → expand to candidates
3. **Slot candidate sets:** For each required SlotSpec, list available fillers + "unknown"

#### Stage B — Generative Predictions → Likelihood
4. **Predict u' = g(v):** what we expect to observe if v were true (semantic, structure, noise model)
5. **Compute prediction error and likelihood:** semantic/structure/slot mismatches → p(u | v)

#### Stage C — Posterior Update
6. **Posterior over candidates:** q(z_subgraph) ∝ p(z_subgraph | anchors) × p(u | v)
7. **Summarize up to Checklist and Goal:** combine candidate evidence with priors
8. **Slot posteriors:** for required slots of top checklist only
9. **Novelty/OOD:** from distance metrics and low anchor similarity

#### Stage D — Active Inference
10. **Uncertainty readout:** entropy, margins, OOD flags
11. **Expected Information Gain:** simulate ASK/SEARCH outcomes
12. **Utility = EIG − Cost − Risk:** pick highest utility action

#### Stage E — Do It, Check It, Learn
13. **Action → new observation:** execute ASK/SEARCH/ANSWER
14. **Posterior predictive check:** generate expected features, check residuals
15. **Update priors over time:** calibrate confidence, EIG estimates, provenance weights
